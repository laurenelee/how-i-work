# How to Work With Me (As Your Colleague)
**Pronouns**: she/her

Hi, I’m Lauren 👋  
I’m thrilled we get to work together. I believe the best teams are built on mutual respect, clarity, and trust. This guide is here to help us skip the awkward calibration phase and get to the good part: collaborating well.  
This isn’t a rulebook. It’s a reflection of how I show up, how I think, and what tends to make collaboration smoother (and more fun).

## A Little About Me

- I’m based just outside Porto, Portugal (moved from Florida in late 2024).  
- I have two kids (Beau and Louie), a background in teaching, and a deep love for triathlons and scuba diving.  
- I came to tech via a bootcamp, which means I care deeply about accessibility, empathy, and real-world learning.  
- I do my best thinking early in the morning (with coffee) and value clear writing, thoughtful feedback, and genuine curiosity.  

## How I Work

- I default to positive intent. I assume everyone is doing their best with the context and constraints they have.  
- I like momentum. I’d rather ship something imperfect and improve it together than get stuck in loops of polish.  
- I think in systems and often zoom out to ask how something fits into the bigger picture.  
- I love it when teammates bring energy and ideas. You don’t need permission to think big around me.  

## What Helps Me

- Clear priorities and a shared understanding of what “done” looks like  
- Artifacts with context. Slack threads are great, but I love a doc with a bit of framing  
- Quick signals. A 👍 on Slack, a “got it,” or a brief check-in means a lot  
- Directness over diplomacy. You can be kind and candid at the same time  

## What to Expect From Me

- I ask a lot of questions. Not to challenge but to understand. I find it helps us get to better answers together.  
- I’m not precious about being right. If you change my mind, I’ll thank you.  
- If I see something that feels off, I’ll bring it up gently but directly.  
- If you need help, I’ll jump in. That said, I’ll sometimes have to remind myself not to overfunction (feel free to nudge me).  

## What You Can Count On

- I’ll give credit where credit’s due, publicly, if you’re comfortable with that  
- I’ll communicate openly and try to bring context, not confusion  
- I’ll own my mistakes and learn from them  
- I’ll ask for feedback (and mean it)  

## Nuances

- If I go quiet, it usually means I’m heads-down or thinking something through. Don’t read it as distance.  
- I sometimes process ideas out loud and may flip perspectives mid-convo. It’s part of how I clarify my own thinking.  
- I love and get energized by collaboration but need solo time to recharge and focus.  
- If I ever overexplain, it’s because I care a lot about setting shared context. I’m working on tightening that up!

## Conflict + Disagreement
- I believe respectful disagreement helps us come up with better ideas.
- If something doesn’t feel right, I’d rather you bring it up than hold it in. I welcome being challenged as long as it’s kind, clear, and focused on shared goals. I’ll do the same.


## 💬 Feedback is Always Welcome
If you have thoughts on how we can collaborate better or feedback on anything I’ve shared here, I’d love to hear it. You can ping me in Slack, bring it to a 1:1, or just say it in the moment.
