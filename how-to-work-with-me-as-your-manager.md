# How to Work With Me (As Your Manager)

Hi, I’m Lauren 👋  
I’m so excited you’re here and part of this team. DevRel is one of the most exciting (and challenging!) disciplines to work in, and my goal is to make sure you feel supported, empowered, and clear on how we work together.

This doc is a living thing and exists to accelerate our working relationship. It’s not about rules. It’s about clarity. If anything feels off or unclear, just ask!

## 🧭 My Role

I’m your manager, but more than that, I’m your advocate. I’m here to:

- Clear blockers
- Help you prioritize
- Support your personal and career growth
- Ensure your work connects to broader goals

I’ll ask for your ideas, give you space to lead, and always welcome feedback.

## ✅ What You Can Expect From Me

- **Strategic context**: I’ll always try to connect the dots between our work and Midnight’s bigger goals.
- **Regular 1:1s**: This is your time. Bring challenges, wins, ideas, feedback—anything. I’ll do the same.
- **Feedback**: I’ll give it regularly, thoughtfully, and privately when constructive. And I’ll always ask for yours too.
- **Transparency**: I’ll let you know what I know (and if I can’t, I’ll say that too).
- **Responsiveness**: I tend to reply quickly on Slack. I don’t expect the same from you—especially outside your working hours.

## 🙌 What I Expect From You

- **Own your work**: You have context - I don’t. I’ll support, not micromanage.
- **Think like a builder**: Try things. Document learnings. Share progress often.
- **Speak up early**: If you’re stuck or unsure—don’t wait. I’d always rather know.
- **Bring your ideas**: Our best work comes from creative people who challenge the status quo.

## 💬 Communication Style

- I prefer Slack for day-to-day communication. Async/threaded updates are great. If it’s urgent, flag it.
- I’m always up for a call to work through complex topics. Just drop it on my calendar or message me directly.
- I love written context. A Confluence doc or brief in Slack goes a long way.
- I value clarity and directness. You never need to read between the lines with me.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 1:1s

- We’ll meet weekly for 30 minutes.
- This is your space. I’ll bring prompts or follow-ups, but the agenda is yours to shape.
- Use this time for feedback, brainstorming, venting—whatever you need that week.
- We’ll track topics and notes in a shared doc or Slack thread.

## 🌈 Fun Facts / Preferences

- I moved to a town outside Porto, Portugal (from Boca Raton, FL) in November 2024 🌴➡️🍷 
- I grew up in the northern suburbs of Chicago, went to university + grad school in Los Angeles, and was a high school English teacher in Seattle for nearly a decade before learning to code 👩‍💻
- I’m a proud graduate of [Ada Developers Academy](https://adadevelopersacademy.org/) and identify as someone who took an unconventional path to tech. As a second career engineer, I pride myself on the ability to approach problems from a unique perspective 👩🏼‍🎓 
- I have a son (Beau, almost 4) and a daughter (Eloise, but we call her Louie, who just turned 1) 👫🏼
- I was the captain of my ice hockey team and am an avid scuba diver (my family owned and operated a dive shop in Belize when I was in high school and college) 🏒🤿
- I’ve run 2 of the 6 Major Marathons and love triathlons 👟 
- I’m a morning person and usually do my best critical thinking before noon ☕ 
- I love actionable content and hate fluff. Make it clear, sharp, and skimmable ✏️
- I thrive on momentum. Shipping small things fast and experimenting gives us data and energy ✨

## 🎯 Final Thought

I want you to feel proud of your work, supported in your role, and connected to our purpose and mission. My job is to help make that happen. Let’s build something great together.
