# How to Work With Me (As Your Manager)

Hi, I’m Lauren 👋  
I’m so excited you’re here and part of this team. DevRel is one of the most exciting (and challenging!) disciplines to work in, and my goal is to make sure you feel supported, empowered, and clear on how we work together.

This doc is a living thing and exists to accelerate our working relationship. It’s not about rules. It’s about clarity. If anything feels off or unclear, just ask!

## 🧭 My Role

I’m your manager, but more than that, I’m your advocate. I’m here to:

- Clear blockers
- Help you prioritize
- Support your personal and career growth
- Ensure your work connects to broader goals

I’ll ask for your ideas, give you space to lead, and always welcome feedback.

## 🗺️ What Guides Me
These values deeply resonate with how I show up as a manager:
- **Integrity**: I believe in doing the right thing, following through, and being candid, even when it’s hard. I’ll give you straight answers and own my commitments.
- **Curiosity**: I ask a lot of questions. Not because I doubt you but because I love learning, pattern-matching, and connecting ideas.
- **Collaboration**: I believe strong teams are built on trust, empathy, and shared ownership. I’ll advocate for you, support you, and celebrate your wins loudly.
You don’t need to memorize these - just know that they shape the way I work, give feedback, and lead.

## ✅ What You Can Expect From Me

- **Strategic context**: I’ll always try to connect the dots between our work and Midnight’s bigger goals.
- **Regular 1:1s**: This is your time. Bring challenges, wins, ideas, feedback—anything. I’ll do the same.
- **Transparency**: I share context early and often. If something’s changing or unclear, I’ll keep you in the loop. And if I don’t have an answer yet, I’ll tell you that too.
- **Responsiveness**: I tend to reply quickly on Slack. I don’t expect the same from you, especially outside your working hours.
- **Feedback**: I’ll give it regularly, thoughtfully, and privately when constructive. And I’ll always ask for yours too.

## 🙌 What I Expect From You

- **Own your work**: You have context - I don’t. I’ll support, not micromanage.
- **Think like a builder**: Try things. Share your progress often. Our best work comes from creative people who explore, experiment, and challenge the status quo.
- **Speak up early**: Please don't wait to communicate if you’re stuck or unsure.
- **Deliver with excellence**: I hold a high bar for quality, clarity, and follow-through, and I aim to model the same. I trust you to deliver great work, and I’ll support you every step of the way.

## 💬 Communication Style

- I prefer Slack for day-to-day communication. Async/threaded updates are great. If it’s urgent, flag it.
- I’m always up for a call to work through complex topics. Just drop it on my calendar or message me directly.
- I love written context. A Confluence doc or brief in Slack goes a long way.
- I value clarity and directness. You never need to read between the lines with me.

## 💥 Conflict + Disagreement
- I believe respectful debate leads to better ideas, stronger outcomes, and more trust over time.
- Healthy disagreement is part of how great teams operate.
- You’ll never get in trouble for pushing back, asking questions, or offering a different perspective. In fact, I appreciate it.
- You can always disagree with me (or each other!) as long as we do it with kindness, clarity, and shared intent. I’ll do the same.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 1:1s

- We’ll meet weekly for 30 minutes.
- This is your space. I’ll bring prompts or follow-ups, but the agenda is yours to shape.
- Use this time for feedback, brainstorming, venting—whatever you need that week.
- We’ll track topics and notes in a shared doc or Slack thread.

## 📝 Feedback is Always Welcome

I always welcome feedback. Whether it's about how I show up or how we work together, you can drop it in our 1:1 doc, DM me, or say it in the moment. Your input helps me grow, and I genuinely appreciate it.
